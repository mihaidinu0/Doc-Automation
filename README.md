# Immigration Documents Automation
This project is a collaboration between the author and a law office from Bucharest, that was successful in automating the document processing for the immigration of over 1000 foreign citizens in Romania. The project was carried out between August and October 2022, and was aimed at drastically reducing the time required for the document processing.

# Project Overview
The project was approached with a Divide & Conquer strategy, in which different tasks were identified and automated to streamline the entire process. The following technologies were used:

- Python for data extraction from PDFs
- Visual Basic for document generation in Microsoft Word
- UiPath Studio for automatic email attachment download and document processing
- Google API for email attachment download

The successful implementation of these technologies allowed for the efficient automation of the immigration document processing, saving hundreds of hours and allowing for more people to find a workplace faster.

# Results
Before the automation, the process took an average of 20 minutes per document. After the automation was implemented, the time required for the document processing was reduced by over 80%, taking an average of only 4 minutes per document.

The following results were achieved during the project:

- Working time reduced by over 80%
- Average time required for document processing reduced from 20 minutes to 4 minutes
- Hundreds of hours saved as the project developed
- Streamlined workflows and tasks

The project has been highly successful in meeting its objectives, and the automation of the immigration document processing has allowed for more people to find a workplace faster. The collaboration with the law office has been a valuable experience and we are proud to have delivered a successful project.
